# ai_minecraft
This is a project in the works. It currently contains a few algorithms used for traversing mazes, climbing hills, and reacting to percepts in constrained environments (Mazes and arena builders not included in this repo (YET!)). Made to run on Raspbian OS Minecraft. 

# Purpose
This project is suited for educational purposes, and could ideally be used as a capstone for youth porgramming tracks. I got the idea from my work with Blossom Scholastic, constantly catching the campers playing Minecraft when they should be focused on learning! 

**You kids think you know Minecraft?? I'll show you some Minecraft!**
