# ai_minecraft
This is a project in the works, and made to run on Raspbian OS Minecraft. It currently contains a few algorithms, including **Depth First Traversal**, **Breadth First Traversal**, **A-Star Pathfinding**, **Hill Climbing**, and that for a **Reactive Agent** used for traversing mazes, climbing hills, and reacting to precepts in constrained environments (Mazes and arena builders not included in this repo (YET!)). It is a little janky at the moment without the arena, but I'll get around to that soon! You can build your own arenas, and modify the start and finish points to suit your own needs for now!

# Purpose
This project is suited for educational purposes, and could ideally be used as a capstone for youth porgramming tracks. I got the idea from my work with Blossom Scholastic, teaching on the Raspbian OS, and constantly catching the campers playing the native Minecraft when they should be focused on learning!


**You kids think you know Minecraft?? I'll show you some Minecraft!**
